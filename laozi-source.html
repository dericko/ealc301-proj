The tau (reason) which can be tau-ed (reasoned) is not the Eternal 
Tau (Reason). 
The name which can be named is not the Eternal Name.</p>
Non-existence is named the Antecedent of heaven and earth; and Existence is 
named the Mother of all things. In eternal non-existence, therefore, man seeks 
to pierce the primordial mystery; and, in eternal existence, to behold the 
issues of the Universe. But these two are one and the same, and differ only in 
name.</p>

<blockquote>

The TAO, or Principle of Nature, may be discussed [by all]; it is 
not the popular or common Tao.</p>
Its Name may be named [i.e., the TAO may receive a 
designation, though of itself it has none]; but it is not an ordinary name, [or 
name in the usual sense of the word, for it is a presentment or &#949;&#953;&#948;&#969;&#955;&#959;&#957; of the 
Infinite].</p>
Its nameless period was that which preceded the birth of the Universe,</p>
In being spoken of by name, it is as the Progenitrix of All Things.</p>
It is therefore in habitual passionlessness [the Quiescent phase of TAO] 
that its mystery may be scanned; and in habitual desire [the Active phase of TAO] 
that its developments may be perceived.</p>
These two conditions, the Active and the Quiescent, alike proceed [from TAO]; 
it is only in name that they differ. Both may be called profundities; and the 
depth of profundity is the gate of every mystery.</p>

The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao.

(Conceived of as) having no name, it is the Originator of heaven and earth;

Always without desire we must be found,
If its deep mystery we would sound;
But if desire always within us be,
Its outer fringe is all that we shall see.</p>
Under these two aspects, it is really the same; but as development takes place, 
it receives the different names. Together we call them the Mystery. Where the 
Mystery is the deepest is the gate of all that is subtle and wonderful.</p>

God (the great everlasting infinite First Cause from whom all things in heaven

For the God which can be defined or named is but the Creator, the Great Mother 
of all those things of which our senses have cognisance.</p>
Now he who would gain a knowledge of the nature and attributes of the nameless 
and undefinable God, must first set himself free from all earthly desires, for 
unless he can do this, he will be unable to penetrate the material veil which 
interposes between him and those spiritual conditions into which he would obtain 
an insight.</p>
Yet the spiritual and the material, though known to us under different names, 
are similar in origin, and issue from the same source, and the same obscurity 
belongs to both, for deep indeed is the darkness which enshrouds the portals 
through which we have to pass, in order to gain a knowledge of these mysteries.</p>

Therefore doth the wise man seek after the first mystery of the Non-Existent,

The Principle that can be enunciated is not the one that always was. The being 
that can be named is not the one that was at all times. Before time, there was 
an ineffable, unnameable being.</p>
When it was still unnameable, it conceived Heaven and Earth. When it had thus 
become nameable, it gave birth to the multitude of beings.</p>
These two acts are but one, under different denominations. The unique act of 
generation; that is the mystery of the beginning; the mystery of mysteries; the 
door through which have issued, onto the scene of the universe, all of the 
marvels which it contains.</p>
The knowledge that man has of the universal Principle depends on his state of 
mind. The mind habitually free from passion knows its mysterious essence; the 
habitually passionate mind knows only its effects.</p>

The Tao that can be understood cannot be the primal, or cosmic, Tao, just as an

And yet this ineffable Tao was the source of all spirit and matter, and being 
expressed was the mother of all created things.

Therefore not to desire the things of sense is to know the freedom of 
spirituality; and to desire is to learn the limitation of matter. These two 
things spirit and matter, so different in nature, have the same origin. This 
unity of origin is the mystery of mysteries, but it is the gateway to

non-existence; existence is only the mother of its evolution.</p>
Since human beings are a small likeness of the great Universe, they can only 
realize their Taohood by making close imitations of it. Before one can attain 
the supreme perfection of Taohood, he must first realize its inmost mystery, 
that is, he must enter the door of this mystery of mysteries.</p>
There are two ways for effecting this realization, both of which can be followed 
by the human organism. One way to realize the wonderful mystery of TAO is to put 
away all thoughts and desires. The other way is to concentrate both true

The Way that may truly be regarded as the Way is other than a permanent way.
The terms that may truly be regarded as terms are other than permanent terms.
The term Non-being indicates the beginning of heaven and earth; the term Being 
indicates the mother of the ten thousand things.
For, indeed, it is through the constant alteration between Non-being and Being 
that the wonder of the one and the limitation of the other will be seen.
These two, having a common origin, are named with different terms.
What they have in common is called the Mystery, The Mystery of Mysteries, the 
Gate of all Wonders.</p>

Nature can never be completely described, for such a description of Nature would 
have to duplicate Nature.</p>
No name can fully express what it represents.</p>
It is Nature itself, and not any part (or name or description) abstracted from 
Nature, which is the ultimate source of all that happens, all that comes and 
goes, begins and ends, is and is not.</p>
But to describe Nature as &#147;the ultimate source of all&#148; is still only a 
description, and such a description is not Nature itself. Yet since, in order to 
speak of it, we must use words, we shall have to describe it as &#147;the ultimate 
source of all.&#148;</p>
If Nature is inexpressible, he who desires to know Nature as it is in itself 
will not try to express it in words.</p>
To try to express the inexpressible leads one to make distinctions which are 
unreal.</p>
Although the existence of Nature and a description of that existence are two 
different things, yet they are also the same.</p>
For both are ways of existing. That is, a description of existence must have its 
own existence, which is different from the existence of that which it describes; 
and so again we have to recognize an existence which cannot be described.</p>

Some possible interpretations of the first line:</p>
The Tao that can be told (/walked/perceived) is not the eternal (/unchanging) 
Tao.</p>
A way that can be walked is not the eternal way.</p>
The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. (Legge)</p>
The Tao (that your mind) conceives of as Tao, is decidedly not the True Tao. 
(Ming)</p>
The way that can be walked is not the way to the Eternal.</p>
Paths can be walked but not the Eternal Path.</p>
The Tao that can be expressed is not the Tao of the Absolute. (Wing)</p>
Tao becomes Tao; it is not just an eternal Tao. (Ming)</p>
Let the Tao become your Tao. It is not just an Eternal Tao.</p>
Tao is ever-becoming Tao; there is no fixed Tao.</p>

Ever without desires (/attachment) then perceive its essence (/your true nature)
Ever with desires (/attachment) then perceive its manifestation (/your 
individual form)</p>
Identifying with [the mind&#146;s] pure awareness reveals its true nature
Identifying with [the mind&#146;s] limited awareness reveals the world of thoughts</p>
The state of wu yü reveals, &#147;I am the Essence&#148;
The state of yu yü reveals, &#147;I am the body&#148;</p>
The Eternal, [seen] through one&#146;s pure awareness, reveals its essence
The Eternal, [seen] through one&#146;s ego-concepts, reveals its outer forms</p>
The Eternal appears in its true wonder to one whose mind is perfectly still
The Eternal appears ordinary, as the apparent forms of this world, to one whose 
mind is dictated by its thoughts</p>
By constant Non-being, we desire to perceive its essence
By constant Being, we desire to perceive its manifestation</p>
Therefore let there always be non-being, so we may see their subtlety, and let 
there always be being, so we may see their outcomes. (Chan)</p>
In eternal non-existence, therefore, man seeks to pierce the primordial mystery; 
and, in eternal existence, to behold the issues of the Universe. (Chalmers)</p>
The thought-free awareness, brought about by the mind turned within, lets a 
person behold his true nature &#151; eternal, wondrous, the manifestation of one 
reality.
The awareness that results from the mind turned outward lets a person see his 
life in this world &#151; passing, ordinary, filled with differences.</p>
A mind that is perfectly still and turned inward reflects the pure awareness of 
its boundless nature;
A mind that is restless and turned outward lives in the cage of its own 
thoughts.</p>

These two are alike in origin but differ in name.</p>
These two are the same but we think of them in different ways.</p>
These pairs of opposites form a unity though we think of them as being 
different.</p>

Unity is its (the world&#146;s) primal origin (first beginning).
It is the origin of the origin,
The opening that leads to (/reveals) the true nature of the Absolute.</p>
That which we call &#147;the One&#148; is hidden.
It is hidden within the hidden yet it is the Essence which reveals everything 
(/yet it is the One, Underlying Principle that becomes everything).</p>
Oneness is the principle that underlies all things.
It is the origin of the origin, the root of the root, the cause of all causes,
It is that which reveals the essence of everything.</p>

Unity, by what we call it, cannot be known</p>
This unity can be spoken of, but remains a mystery</p>
This unity is incomprehensible, beyond the reaches of the mind</p>
T&#146;ung wei (the One and what it calls into being) is a mystery</p>
The One, Absolute, is its (the world&#146;s) origin</p>
There is only one original substance (yüan)</p>
Oneness is the nature of its origin</p>

Mystery is again a mystery
There is a secret within this secret
It is the origin of the origin</p>
This unity is hidden.
It is the hidden within itself, it is . . .</p>
