"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the ineffable Tao. The name that can be spoken is not the ineffable name. The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; The named is the mother of the myriad things. Thus, cleave to nonbeing in order to observe its etherealities; Cleave to being in order to observe its manifestations. These two emerge together but are differently named; Together they are referred to as the Dankly Mysterious. More abstruse than mysterious, The gate to a myriad etherealities."
