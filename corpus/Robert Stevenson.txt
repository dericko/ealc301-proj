"   The way of ways is not the true Way. The name of names is not the true Name. The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. That with name is the mother of all creation. Thus, with true Nothingness one may view the mystery, And with true Being one may perceive the barrier. These two are of the same origin, yet their names differ. These two are called Profound. Beyond the Profound lies the gateway to the Universal Mystery."
