"     No Tao that may be Tao is the constant Tao; No name that may be a name is the constant name. By non-being you name the beginning of Heaven and Earth; By being you name the mother of the ten thousand things. Therefore, always free of desire you see the secret; Always with desire you see its appearance. These two Are the same in origin yet different in name. Their sameness may be called a mystery. It is the mystery beyond mysteries, The gate to myriad secrets."
