"   The Tao that can be expressed      is not the Everlasting Tao. The Name that can be named      is not the Everlasting Name.  He whose name is \u201cSpirit in Man\u201d      is Life-spring of Heaven and Earth. He whose name is \u201coutward possessions\u201d      is Mother of all created beings.  Therefore constantly desire Inner Life      in order to perceive mysteries. Constantly desire possessions      in order to perceive limitations.  These two: One in source but differing in Name      are One in being called deep,      Deep and yet more deep,      Door of many mysteries."
