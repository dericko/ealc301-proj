"  Who would follow the Way      must go beyond words. Who would know the world      must go beyond names.  Nameless, all things begin. Named, all things are born.  Empty of intent, one may be filled with awe. Full of intent, one may know what\u2019s manifest. One source, different fonts. Wonders both.  From wonder into wonder, existence opens."
