"   A Way become Way isn\u2019t the perennial Way. A name become name isn\u2019t the perennial name:  the named is mother to the ten thousands things, but the unnamed is origin of all heaven and earth.  In perennial nonbeing you see mystery, and in perennial being you see appearance. Though the two are one and the same, once they arise, they differ in name.  One and the same they\u2019re called dark-enigma, dark-enigma deep within dark-enigma,  gateway of all mystery."
