"   Any dao given by language is not a constant dao, Any labeling given by words is not constant labeling. \u201cAbsence\u201d names the beginning of the universe, \u201cpermanence\u201d names the matrix of all things.  Therefore: Treat \u201cabsence\u201d as constant if you desire to view its wonders, Treat \u201cpresence\u201d as constant if you desire to view its manifestations. These two emerge in union but are named differently, their union speaks of mystery: mystery upon mystery \u2014 the gateway to a whole mass of wonders!"
