"   The Dao that can be told is not the timeless Dao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. Heaven and earth emerged from the nameless. The named is the mother of all things. Lose desire to see the Dao\u2019s essence. Have desire to see the Dao\u2019s manifestations. These two have the same source but different names. Their sameness is a mystery, mystery of mysteries, gateway of untold secrets."
