"   Tao that can be spoke of, not the eternal Tao. Name that can be named, not the eternal name. Nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth. Named, mother of everything. Desireless, sees the mystery. Desiring, sees the manifestations. These two, from the same source, differ in name; both are original. Original of original, gate of all mystery."
