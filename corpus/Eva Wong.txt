"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the real way. That which can be named is only transient. The nameless was there before the sky and the earth were born. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. In nothingness you will see its wonders; In things you will see its boundaries. These two come from the same origin, although they have different names. They emerged from somewhere deep and mysterious. This deep and mysterious place Is the gateway to all wonders."
