"   The Providence which could be indicated by words would not be an all-embracing Providence, nor would any name by which we could name it be an ever-applicable name.  \u201cNon-existence\u201d is a name for the beginning of heaven and earth. \u201cExistence\u201d is a name for the genetrix of the innumerable objects of creation.  Hence, \u201cabsolute non-existence\u201d suggests to us the miraculous working of what in \u201cabsolute existence\u201d has become the resulting essence.  These two emanate from the same, though their namings are dissimilar, and jointly they are termed \u201cstate of colourless dissolution.\u201d Dissolution, again, within dissolution this connects us with the various miraculous workings."
