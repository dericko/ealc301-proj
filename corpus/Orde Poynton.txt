"   A way that can be described is not the Eternal Way: A name that can be named is not the Eternal Name. The source of the Cosmos is nameless: The origin of an object rests in the possession of a name. That which is ever without desire is to be accounted the Secret Essence: That which manifests desire must be regarded as a phenomenon. When two things that were one are differentiated they are then given different names.
