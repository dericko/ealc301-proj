"     The Flow of the universe is not one you can explain, And its true name is not one you can speak.  For the universe began without words, And then we gave names to all things. In the world of non-being, we embrace its mysteries, And in the world of being, we interact with it.  These two flow into one another And are separated only by name.  Together they form a mystery. Enigma in enigma \u2014 Gateway to all wonders."
