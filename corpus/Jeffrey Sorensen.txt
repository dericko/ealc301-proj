"   The tao that can be tar(1)ed is not the entire Tao. The PATH that can be specified is not the full PATH.  We declare the names of all variables and functions. Yet the Tao has no type specifier.  Dynamically binding, you realize the magic. Statically binding, you see only the hierarchy.  Yet magic and hierarchy arise from the same source, and this source has a null pointer.  Reference the NULL within NULL, it is the gateway to all wizardry."
