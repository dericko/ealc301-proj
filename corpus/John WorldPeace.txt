"   The infinity that can be conceived is not the everlasting Infinity. The infinity that can be described is not the perpetual Infinity.  The inconceivable indescribable is the essence of the all encompassing Infinite. Conceiving and describing applies only to the manifestations of Infinity.  Free from distinctions, experience the oneness of Infinity. Focus on distinctions and see only the manifestations of Infinity.  Yet distinction and non-distinction are one within Infinity.  Potential within potential is the essence of Infinity."
