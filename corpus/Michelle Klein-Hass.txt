"   Of the Dao it must be said: Let no man name It. (For that which is named is that which is limited, And that which is limited it that which is destroyed.) No name can fully contain Its mystery.  That which cannot be named is from whence Reality springs, That which can be named is the perceivable source.  Cleanse yourself from Lust of Result (Expectation) and you will see without constriction. Remain ensnared in its grip, and you will only see the wall you have erected in front of you.  Beyond this wall is Reality, and the wall and Reality are one.  And both together are the Great Mystery."
