"   The Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao. The Name that can be spoken is not the eternal name. The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. The Named is the mother of all creatures. Observe the mysteries of the Tao without longing. Survey its appearance with desire. Both mysteries and appearance come from the same origin but wear a different name; they are enigmatic. The greatest mystery is the gate to all mysteries."
