"   A Tao that can be tao-ed is not lasting Tao.  A name that can be named is not lasting name.  Name-less \u2014 the beginning of Heaven and Earth.  Named \u2014 the mother of all things.  So, we must be always without desires to see the mystery:  If we always have desires we will see its limits:  These two are the same; once there is out-going, then there is difference of name.  As the same they are called obscure. The obscure of the obscure is the gate of all mysteries."
