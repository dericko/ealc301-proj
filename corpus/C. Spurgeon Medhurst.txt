"   The Tao which can be expressed is not the unchanging Tao; the name which can be named is not the unchanging name.  The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; the mother of all things is the nameable.  Thus, while the eternal non-being leads toward the fathomless, the eternal being conducts to the boundary. Although these two (the Tao and its twofold aspect) have been differently named they come from the same.  As the same they may be described as the abysmal. The abyss of the abysmal is the gate of all mystery."
