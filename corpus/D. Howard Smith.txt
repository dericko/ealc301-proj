"   That which can be thought of as Tao (lit. Tao that can be tao\u2019d) is not the absolute Tao. Whatever name that can be applied is not its absolute name. Nameless, it is the source of heaven and earth. Named, it is the mother of all things. Therefore, considered as absolute \u201cnon-being\u201d we desire to see into its mystery; as absolute \u201cbeing\u201d we desire to observe its limitations. These two (non-being and being), though identical in origin, emerge under different names. Their common identity is called mysterious, mystery of mysteries, the gate of all mystery."
