"   The Way that may truly be regarded as the Way is other than a permanent way. The terms that may truly be regarded as terms are other than permanent terms. The term Non-being indicates the beginning of heaven and earth; the term Being indicates the mother of the ten thousand things. For, indeed, it is through the constant alteration between Non-being and Being that the wonder of the one and the limitation of the other will be seen. These two, having a common origin, are named with different terms. What they have in common is called the Mystery, The Mystery of Mysteries, the Gate of all Wonders."
