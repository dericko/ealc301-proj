"   The DAO that can be expressed is not the eternal DAO. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.  \u201cNon-existence\u201d I call the beginning of Heaven and Earth. \u201cExistence\u201d I call the mother of individual beings.  Therefore does the direction towards non-existence lead to the sight of the miraculous essence, the direction towards existence to the sight of spatial limitations.  Both are one in origin and different only in name. In its unity it is called the secret. The secret\u2019s still deeper secret is the gateway through which all miracles emerge."
