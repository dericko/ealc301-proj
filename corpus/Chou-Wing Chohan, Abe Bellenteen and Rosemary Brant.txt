"   The Tao that can be expressed in words is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be defined in words is not the name that never changes. Non-existence is what we call the source of heaven and earth. Existence is the mother of all things. From eternal non-existence, therefore, we observe the beginning of the existence of the many hidden qualities of the universe. From eternal existence, therefore, we clearly observe the overt qualities of the universe. These two, the hidden and the overt, are originally the same at source, and become different where they manifest themselves. This same origin is \u201cthe smallest of the small.\u201d The absolute \u201csmallest of the small\u201d is the gate from which the beginning of all the parts of the universe emerges."
