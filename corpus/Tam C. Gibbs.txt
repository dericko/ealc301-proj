"   The tao that can be said is not the everlasting Tao. If a name can be named, it is not the everlasting Name. That which has no name is the origin of heaven and earth; That which has a name is the Mother of all things. Thus, if always without desire, one can observe indescribable marvels; If always desirous, one sees merest traces. These two come from the same source but are differently named. Both are called Mysterious. The mystery of the Mysterious is the gateway to all indescribable marvels."
