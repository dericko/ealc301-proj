"   Ways that can be spelled out cannot be the eternal way. Names that can be named must change with time and place. Emptiness is the origin of heaven and earth; Existence is the mother of everything that had a birth. Appreciate Emptiness, that we may see the nature of the Dao\u2019s versatility; Appreciate Existence, that we may see the extent of the Dao\u2019s possibilities. These two, Emptiness and Existence, came from the same source. Though they bear different names, they serve the same mystical cause. A mystery within a mystery, such is the gateway to all versatility."
