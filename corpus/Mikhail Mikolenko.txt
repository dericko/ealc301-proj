"  One cannot know Tao only by speaking about It. One cannot name by human name that Origin of the sky and earth Which is the Mother of everything. Only he who is free from worldly passions can see It; and he who has such passions can see only Its Creation. Tao and Its Creation are One in essence though called by different names. The passage which exists between them is the door to all the miraculous."
