"   The Tao which can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao; The name which can be named is not the eternal Name. \u201cNon-Being\u201d names this beginning of Heaven and Earth; \u201cBeing\u201d names the mother of the myriad things. Therefore, some people constantly dwell in \u201cNon-Being\u201d Because they seek to perceive its mysteries, While some constantly dwell in \u201cBeing\u201d Because they seek to perceive its boundaries. These two [\u201cNon-Being\u201d and \u201cBeing\u201d] are of the same origin, But have different names; Together they are called abstruse \u2014 Abstruse and again abstruse, This is the gate of all mysteries."
