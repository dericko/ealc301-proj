"   The way that can be shown is not the Eternal Way. The name that can be named is not the Eternal Name.  The source of the Heavens and the Earth is nameless. Naming is the Mother of the ten thousand things.  Willingly we find the mystery; Willfully we find the forms.  The forms and the mystery are the same And yet their names are different. Together they are called the Profound; The mystery within the Mystery; The Gateway to Salvation."
