"   The \u201cTao\u201d is too great to be described by the name \u201cTao.\u201d If it could be named so simply, it would not be the eternal Tao.  Heaven and Earth began from the nameless (Tao), but the multitudes of things around us were created by names.  We desire to understand the world by giving names to the things we see, but these things are only the effects of something subtle.  When we see beyond the desire to use names, we can sense the nameless cause of these effects.  The cause and the effects are aspects of the same, one thing. They are both mysterious and profound. At their most mysterious and profound point lies the \u201cGate of the Great Truth.\u201d"
