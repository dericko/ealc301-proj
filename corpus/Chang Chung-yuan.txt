"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the Tao itself. The name that can be given is not the name itself. The unnameable is the source of the universe. The nameable is the originator of all things.

Since their emergence, they have been called by different names. Their identity is called the mystery. From mystery to further mystery: The entry of all wonders!"
