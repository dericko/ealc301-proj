"   Ways can be told, But not the lasting way. Names can be named, But not the lasting name.  Nameless was the beginning Of heaven and earth. Names were the birth Of the ten thousand things.  Those without desire Will see its inner core; Those with desire Will see its outer form.  Both are simply aspects Of the same mysterious whole That has worn different names. Both are curiosities.  When curiosity is greatest The gateway to eternity opens wide."
