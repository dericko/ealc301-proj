"   The true way is unknown and so is the untrue way There are no names to understand it Creation does not care that it is the source of creation It emanates as some \u201cthing\u201d And is not without nourishment Mysteries are revealed Become Its way Attain Its perfection Do not use words to describe its no-thing-ness  The three are the same but distinct One is the Body One is the Heart One is the Mind To understand it as one is the most you can do It is the path to higher and lesser knowledge"
