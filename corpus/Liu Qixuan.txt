"   There are ways to follow, But what is followed is not the true Way. There are names to give, But what is given is not the true Name. Let us call non-being the beginning of the universe And let us call being the development of all things. When we follow non-being We approach the wonder of the Way. When we follow being We approach the farther-end manifestation of the Way. Each has the same origin, And here exists a metaphysical door to true wisdom."
