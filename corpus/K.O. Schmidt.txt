"     The Tao that can be named is not the absolute Tao. The name that can be uttered is not the name of the Eternal. As the unmanifest it is the origin of heaven and earth; manifest it is the mother of all beings. Whoever free from attachment looks inward with detachment attains the vision of the Unmanifest; whoever is ego-bound and clings to greed sees but the outer show. The Manifest and the Unmanifest although different in name are one in essence. This unity is the mystery of the Tao the unfathomable of the primordial ground the starting point of all manifestation."
