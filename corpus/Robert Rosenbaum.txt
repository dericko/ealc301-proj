"   The Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Way; the name that can be named is not the Immortal Name. Nameless the Source of earth and sky, names engender every thing. Unfettered by desire, the mystery reveals itself; wanting this gives rise to that. Beyond named and nameless, reality still flows; unfathomable the arch, the door, the gate."
