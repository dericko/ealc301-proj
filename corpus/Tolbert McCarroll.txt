"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name.  The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.  Send your desires away and you will see the mystery. Be filled with desire      and you will see only the manifestation.  As these two come forth they differ in name. Yet at their source they are the same. This source is called a mystery.  Darkness within darkness,      the gateway to all mystery."
