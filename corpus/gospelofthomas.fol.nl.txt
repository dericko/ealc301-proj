"   The Ineffable, about which is spoken, is not the eternal Ineffable A name for the Unnameable, is but a name The Unnameable is what makes everything what it is By naming things you divide the Indivisible Only one who gives up all his desires can experience the Indivisible One who still cherishes desires, will experience only dissension Both will see the same reality, but experience it differently One who goes from the false reality into the other, Will pass through the narrow gate and receive the secret of true life"
