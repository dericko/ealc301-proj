"   The Tao that can be followed is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth While naming is the origin of the myriad things. Therefore, always desireless, you see the mystery Ever desiring, you see the manifestations. These two are the same \u2014 When they appear they are named differently. This sameness is the mystery, Mystery within mystery; The door to all marvels."
