"   The Dao that can be defined is not the eternal Dao; and the name of the Dao that can be given is not the name of the eternal Dao. Nothing is what the universe begins with; and something is the mother of all things. Thus through nothingness we are able to observe Dao\u2019s subtlety; and through somethingness we are able to see its boundary. The two come from the same source yet with different names. Both of them are described as profundities, but Dao is even more profound, and a gateway to all mysteries."
