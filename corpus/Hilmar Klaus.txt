"   A dao that can be defined, is not the eternal Dao; concepts that can be conceived, are not eternal concepts! Inconceivable is Heaven\u2019s and Earth\u2019s origin, conceivable is the myriad things\u2019 mother.  Therefore, always without desire, so see its mystery; ever with desire, so see its surface.  These two: together emerging, yet differing in names \u2014 together they are called mysterious. The mystery of mysteries \u2014 the Gate to all Mysteries."
