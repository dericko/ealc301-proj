"   The TAO that can be spoken is not the forever TAO. The name of the TAO uttered is not the forever TAO.  That which is unnamable is real forever. Origins start with names.  When you become desireless you will realize the mystery. When you are trapped by desire you see only the physical side of things . . . the manifestations.  Manifestations and this mystery arise from the same center which is nothingness.  Nothingness within nothingness the pathway to understanding all."
