"   The Tao of words is not the transcendental Tao. The spoken name is not the transcendental name.  The nameless is the beginning of all things. The named is the mother of all things.  Constantly desireless, one can see the subtlety. Constantly desiring, one can only see the manifestations. These two are the same but differ in name. The mystery is in the unity. Where the mystery is most profound is the gateway to all mystery."
