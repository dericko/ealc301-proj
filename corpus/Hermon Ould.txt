"   The Tao that can be expressed is not the Unchanging Tao; The name that can be named is not the Unchanging name. The Unnameable is that from which Heaven and Earth derived, leaving itself unchanged. Thinking of it as having a name, let it be called the Mother of all things. He who is without earthly passions and without desire can perceive the profound mystery of that Unmanifested Existence. He who has not rid himself of desire can perceive only the Manifest, with its differentiations. Nevertheless, the Manifest and the Unmanifest are in origin the same. This sameness is the Mystery of Mysteries, the deep within the deep, the Doorway into all Mystery."
