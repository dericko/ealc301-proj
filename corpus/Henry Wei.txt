"   The Tao that can be stated is not the Eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the Eternal Name. The Unnameable is originator of Heaven and Earth. The Nameable is mother of the ten thousand things. Therefore, Always be desireless, so as to discern Tao\u2019s wonderful essence; Always have some desire, so as to discern its manifestations. These two come from the same source, But are different in name. Their identical nature is a mystery Mystery of mysteries That is the gate of all the wonderful essence."
