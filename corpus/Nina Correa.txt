"  Dao may be accepted as \u201cDao\u201d, but that would conflict with the constant motion of Dao. A name may be accepted as a \u201cName\u201d, but that would conflict with the constant motion of what\u2019s been given a name.  Everything started out without needing to be named or categorized. When they were seen as things that needed to be nurtured, they were then given names.  Therefore: When we\u2019re in the frame of mind of not wanting anything, we look at even the smallest things as being significant. When we\u2019re in the frame of mind of wanting things, we observe boundaries and limits.  Both of those attitudes can fit together with each other, even though they\u2019re thought to be quite different. Trying to fit them together is said to be one of the most profound mysteries. That\u2019s the doorway to even more mysteries."
