"   The Way that can be \u201cWay\u201d-ed Is not the constant Way. The name that can be named Is not the constant name. What has no name is the beginning of heaven and earth, What has a name is the mother of the myriad things. Therefore by constantly having no desire observe the sublimest in it, By constantly having desire observe where it tends. The two have the same source but different names: Call it the same, the \u201cDark.\u201d The darkest of the dark Is the gate of the sublime in everything."
