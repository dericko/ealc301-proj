"   The Way that can be spoken of       is not the changeless DAO.  The name that can be named       is not the changeless Name.  Namelessness: the blank that was before both heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of all living things.  To understand the mysteries of DAO, empty yourself of all desire;       to understand its outward forms, fill yourself with all desire.  DAO and the world flow from the same source, but differ in name. Their oneness is a mystery, a mystery upon a mystery,       the gateway to the essence of everything that is."
