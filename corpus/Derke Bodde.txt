"  The Tao that may be called Tao is not the invariable Tao. The names that can be named are not the invariable names. Non-being is the term given to the form from which Heaven and Earth sprang. Being is the term given to the mother that rears the ten thousand things (on earth). Of the invariable Non-being, we wish to see its secret essences. Of the invariable Being, we wish to see its borders. These two have issued together but are different in name. The two together we call the Mystery. It is the Mystery of Mysteries, the doorway of all secret essences."
