"   A way that can be walked      is not The Way A name that can be named      is not The Name  Tao is both Named and Nameless As Nameless, it is the origin of all things As Named, it is the mother of all things.  A mind free of thought,      merged within itself,      beholds the essence of Tao A mind filled with thought,      identified with its own perceptions,      beholds the mere forms of this world  Tao and this world seem different      but in truth they are one and the same The only difference is in what we call them  How deep and mysterious is this unity      How profound, how great! It is the truth beyond the truth,      the hidden within the hidden It is the path to all wonder,      the gate to the essence of everything!"
