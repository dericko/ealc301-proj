"   IT, if nameable, is not eternal. The name, nameable, is not eternal name. The Nameless is the root of Heaven and Earth, while that that can be named is the Mother of all beings. Therefore he who is without sees it within, he who wants, its boundaries. These two are of one end, though of different name. Unseparated, they are called dark, the Dark's doubly Dark, the Gate of all Reason."
