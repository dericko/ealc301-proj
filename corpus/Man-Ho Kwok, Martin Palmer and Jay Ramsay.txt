"   The Tao that can be talked about is not the true Tao. The name that can be named                               is not the eternal Name. Everything in the universe comes out of Nothing. Nothing \u2014 the nameless                               is the beginning; While Heaven, the mother                               is the creatrix of all things. Follow the nothingness of the Tao,      and you can be like it, not needing anything,           seeing the wonder and the root of everything. And even if you cannot grasp this nothingness, You can still see something of the Tao in everything.      These two are the same           only called by different names \u2014 and both are mysterious and wonderful. All mysteries are Tao, and Heaven is their mother: She is the gateway and the womb-door."
