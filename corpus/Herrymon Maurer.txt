"   If Tao can be Taoed, it\u2019s not Tao. If its name can be named, it\u2019s not its name. Has no name: precedes heaven and earth; Has a name: mother of ten thousand things.  For it is Always dispassionate: see its inwardness; Always passionate: see its outwardness.  The names are different but the source the same. Call the sameness mystery: Mystery of mystery, the door to inwardness."
