"    The Way that can be articulately described       is not the Unchanging Way. The name that can be said out loud       is not the Unchanging Name. With your mouth unopened, and things left undefined,       you stand at the beginning of the universe. Make definitions, and you are the measure of all creation. Thus, being forever without desire,       you look deeply into the transcendent. By constantly harboring desire,       your vision is beset by all the things around you. These two enter the world alike,       but their names are different. Alike, they are called profound and remote. Profound and remote and again more so: This is the gate to all mysteries."
