"   If Tao can be described, then it is not general Tao. If a name can be denied, then it is not a general name. The invisible is the origin of the universe. The visible is the mother of all things. By constantly thinking the invisible, we understand the universe; By constantly observing the visible, we can see how the natural laws work. Thinking and observing are two different things. Yet they serve the same goal: to theorize. Theorizing and evolving these theories is the gate to marvels."
