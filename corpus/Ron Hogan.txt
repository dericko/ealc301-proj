"   If you can talk about it, it ain\u2019t Tao. If it has a name, it\u2019s just another thing.  Tao doesn\u2019t have a name. Names are for ordinary things.  Stop wanting stuff. It keeps you from seeing what\u2019s real. When you want stuff, all you see are things.  These two statements have the same meaning. Figure them out, and you\u2019ve got it made."
