"   The Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way; The names that can be named are not unvarying names. It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang; The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind. Truly, \u201cOnly he that rids himself forever of desire can see the Secret Essences\u201d; He that has never rid himself of desire can see only the Outcomes. These two things issued from the same mould, but nevertheless are different in name. This \u201csame mould\u201d we can but call the Mystery, Or rather the \u201cDarker than any Mystery,\u201d The Doorway whence issued all Secret Essences."
