"    The Finite cannot be all of the Infinite! THOU by any specific name is not all there is to THOU. The un-nameable is the Father of the myriads of things. The nameable is the Mother of its own myriads of things. Therefore; never wanting, one may observe the wondrously subtle; Desiring, one may witness the manifestations.  Both of these are attributes of the same Source. They have different \u2019nameabilities\u2019 but the same designation:  Mystery of Mysteries, the Gate of all wonders!"
