"   The DAO can be talked about, but that is not the ever-lasting DAO. The NAME can be called, but that is not the ever-lasting NAME. Nothingness is called the origin of the world. Existence is called the root of everything. Therefore, You should stay in nothingness if you want to see the true essence of the world: you should stay in existence if you want to see the different entities of the world. They are from the same source but named differently: both are called XUAN. Understanding the XUANs is the key to the kingdom of truth."
