"   To guide what can be guided is not constant guiding. To name what can be named is not constant naming. \u201cNot-exist\u201d names the beginning (boundary) of the cosmos (Heaven and earth) \u201cExists\u201d names the mother of the ten-thousand natural kinds. Thus, to treat \u201cnot-exist\u201d as constant is desiring to use it to view its mysteries. To treat \u201cexists\u201d as constant is desiring to use it to view its manifestations. These two emerge together yet have different names. \u201cTogether\u201d \u2014 call that \u201cobscure.\u201d \u201cObscure\u201d it and it is more obscure. . . . the gateway of a crowd of mysteries."
