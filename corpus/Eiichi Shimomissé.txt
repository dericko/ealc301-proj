"   The Tao that refers to here can never be the mundane tao. The Name that is used here to designate is not a mundane name. The Tao that is unnameable is the Source of the Heaven and the Earth. The name, once introduced, becomes the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things. Without desires one sees its profound mystery revealed. With desires one can always see its countless appearances. They are primarily one and same and yet differ in names. These two ways of revelation are indeed the oldest mystery of dark mysteries. To understand this is the gate to all mysteries."
