"   The Principle that can be enunciated is not the one that always was. The being that can be named is not the one that was at all times. Before time, there was an ineffable, unnameable being.  When it was still unnameable, it conceived Heaven and Earth. When it had thus become nameable, it gave birth to the multitude of beings.  These two acts are but one, under different denominations. The unique act of generation; that is the mystery of the beginning; the mystery of mysteries; the door through which have issued, onto the scene of the universe, all of the marvels which it contains.  The knowledge that man has of the universal Principle depends on his state of mind. The mind habitually free from passion knows its mysterious essence; the habitually passionate mind knows only its effects."
