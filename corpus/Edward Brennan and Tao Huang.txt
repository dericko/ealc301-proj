"   The Tao that is voiced is no longer that of eternal Tao. The name that has been written is no longer that of eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of the cosmic universe. The named is the mother of the myriad creatures. Being at peace, one can see into the subtle. Engaging with passion, one can see into the manifest. They both arise from a common source but have different names. Both are called the mystery within the mystery. They are the door to all wonders."
