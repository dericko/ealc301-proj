"   Tao that can be described is not the universal and eternal Tao; Name that can be named is not the universal and eternal name. The beginning of Heaven and Earth is nameless; The mother of everything is naming. Thus: Be always objective, one discover the wonders; Be always subjective, one only sees the manifestations. Both emerge from the same source, but with different names. Both are mysterious. The mystery hidden inside of mysteries Is the door to all wonders."
