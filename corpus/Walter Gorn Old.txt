"   The Tao that is the subject of discussion is not the true Tao. The quality which can be named is not its true attribute. That which was before Heaven and Earth is called the Non-Existent. The Existent is the mother of all things. Therefore doth the wise man seek after the first mystery of the Non-Existent, while seeing in that which exists the Ultimates thereof. The Non-Existent and Existent are identical in all but name. This identity of apparent opposites I call the profound, the great deep, the open door of bewilderment."
