"   The tao (way) that can be told is not the eternal Tao The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.  The emptiness can be called the origin of the universe. The forming can be regarded as the mother of all particular things.  With emptiness you see the subtlety. With naming you see the manifestations. The \"emptiness\" is no different from the \"form\" intrinsically. They both may be called deep and profound. Deeper and more profound. The gateway to all subtlety."
