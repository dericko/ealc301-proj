"   The Way that can be described is not the absolute Way; the name that can be given is not the absolute name. Nameless it is the source of heaven and earth; named it is the mother of all things.  Whoever is desireless, sees the essence of life. Whoever desires, sees its manifestations. These two are the same, but what is produced has names. They both may be called the cosmic mystery: from the cosmic to the mystical is the door to the essence of all life."
