"  Direction, as expressed, is no ordinary direction; as named, no ordinary name. Null identifies the universe at the beginning. Ull [all] identifies the mother of myriad matters. Thus, visit Null to observe its intricateness. Visit Ull to observe its limitlessness. These two spring from the same sort; only their identifications differ. Both are profound. Profound upon profound, it is the portal to all intricacies."
