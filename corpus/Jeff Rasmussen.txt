"  Spoken Tao is not eternal Tao Spoken name is not eternal name  Nameless is the source of all Named is the source of the myriad things  Ever desireless one sees wonders Ever desiring one sees manifestations  These two are the same in origin yet differ in name  The origin is the great mystery Gateway to all understanding."
