"   Tao is beyond words      and beyond understanding. Words may be used to speak of it,      but they cannot contain it.  Tao existed before words and names,      before heaven and earth,      before the ten thousand things. It is the unlimited father and mother      of all limited things.  Therefore, to see beyond boundaries      to the subtle heart of things,      dispense with names,      with concepts,      with expectations and ambitions and differences.  Tao and its many manifestations      arise from the same source:      subtle wonder within mysterious darkness.  This is the beginning of all understanding."
