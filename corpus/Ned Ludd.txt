"   The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The names that can be given are not the eternal names. The Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of all things. Therefore, without intentions, I see the Subtle Essence. And with intentions, I see the Manifest Forms. These two are the same, though each has many names. Both may be called the Mystery."
