"   A way can be shown: it is not the constant way. A name can be named: it is not the constant name. The nameless is the embryo of Heaven and Earth; The named is the mother of the myriad beings. Thus: constantly desireless, to observe the subtleties; Constantly desirous, to observe the evident. There two come out the same, but are named differently: Together they are called dark. The further darkness of darkness: The gateway to the many subtleties."
