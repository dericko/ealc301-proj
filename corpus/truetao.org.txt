"   The Tao that can be spoken is not the constant Tao The Name that can be named is not the constant Name The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth The named is the mother of myriad things Thus, constantly free of desire One observes its wonder Constantly filled with desire One observes its manifestations These two emerge similarly but differ in name The unity is the mystery Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders"
