"   The Dao which one can explain is not the unchanging Dao. The name which one can name is not the unchanging name. Nothingness is the name of the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Existence is the name of the mother of all things. Therefore one should always emphasize nothingness if one desires to observe the marvelousness of the Dao; one should always emphasize existence if one desires to observe the limits of the Dao. These two have the same origin but different names; one can call both of them profound. More profound than profound, they are the gate of all marvelous things."
