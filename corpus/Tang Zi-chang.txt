Having-naught namecalling : Heaven-Earth\u2019s fetation,           Having-aught namecalling : Myriad Mottlings\u2019 mother. Affirmably, Forewont Have-naught Desired \u2014 for to descry in view the minikin-subliminaria, Forewont Have-aught Desired \u2014 for to descry in view the circuit-luminaria;           These pairing ones at-one           Egressing,           Diverse namecall :           At-one \u2014 bespeak such : Darkling,           Adarkling such, again adarkling           The thronging subliminaria\u2019s gate.  \u201cTranslation\u201d by Peter A. Boodberg (1968)   Dao that can be talked about is not the eternal Dao itself; A name that can be given is not the eternal thing itself. The nameless existed Before the birth of Heaven and Earth \u2014 Universe The names which were given were after The birth of All Things. By the eternity of unknown existence Comprehend the common essence of things; By the eternity of Existence Observe the apparent differences. These two came from the same origin \u2014 the unknown But with different names. They all are called the \u201cprofoundness\u201d Profoundly and profoundly it is the entrance From which come all wonders."
