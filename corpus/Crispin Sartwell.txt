"  This book can tell you nothing; the Tao leaves you where you began. A maiden can leave things nameless; a mother must name her children. In innocence or experience, you still return. Calling things by name loses what unites them. Failing to call things by name loses them into what unites them. Words are limits that make experience possible. But form and formlessness are the same. Tao and the world are the same, though we call them by different names. This unity is dark and deep, but on the other hand it is deep and dark. It opens into the center of everything."
