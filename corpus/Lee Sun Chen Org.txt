"   Tao (Truth) can be talked about (theorized in any manner each person considers viable), though hardly of these theories will be eternally valid;  Names (Descriptions) can be ascribed [to Tao in any fashion each person deems workable], yet hardly of these names (descriptions) will last forever.  The beginning of the Universe (Heaven and Earth) [is beyond us, so in all honesty it] is indescribable;  [Nevertheless,] whatever is namable (describable) by us served as the mother (origin) of [our knowledge of] myriad (all and every) things and creatures.  Accordingly,  I constantly refrain from my selfish (subjective) desires for the purpose of exploring its (Nature\u2019s) manifested (apparent) wonder;  I also constantly maintain my will [to seek objective knowledge] in order to pursue its (Nature\u2019s) deep-seated enigma.  These two (Tao and Te) were originated from the same source, but they were described with different names by us.  They are both depicted as profound [as each is intricate in its own right];  The profundity (complexity) intensifies as we fathom its mystery further and deeper;  Eventually, it will [lead us] to the gateway of all mysteries."
