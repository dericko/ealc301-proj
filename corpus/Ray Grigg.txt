"   The Tao that can be named      is not the nameless Tao. The Tao that can be known      is not the unknowable Tao.  Nameless and unknowable,      the Tao has been from the very beginning. It is the wisdom of all that is,      and the way of the Great Mother.  With desire,      the Tao is hidden. Without desire,      the Tao is apparent.  The Tao and the Great Mother      arose from the same dark source Their names are different,      but they are inseparable.  Together they are an endless wonder, And the boundless mystery      of everything\u2019s oneness."
