"   The Tao that can be defined is not the real Tao. The name that can be named is not the real Name. The unnamable [Tao] is the source of Heaven and Earth. Naming is the mother of all particular things. Free from desire, you experience reality. Trapped in desire, you see only appearances. Reality and appearance have different names, but they emerge from the same source [i.e., the Tao]. This source is called darkness, deep darkness; and yet it is the way to all wisdom."
