"   The Tao you can tell is not the true Tao. The names you can name are not the true names. The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of the myriad things. Always desireless you see its very essence. Always desiring you see its outer edge. The source of these two is the same Yet they are differently named. They are called the mystery, Mystery upon mystery, The gateway to the essence of all."
