"   The way that can be overtrod is not the Eternal Way,      The name that can be named is not the Everlasting Name Which Nameless brought forth Heaven and Earth, which Named, if name we may,      The Mother of all the myriad things of time and space      became. Thereby we sound eternally the mystery divine,      But only without desire to sound, for if desire abide The portals of the issuing host our baffled sight confine,      And deep within the eternal veil the mystery shall hide. These two, the Nameless and the Named, they differ but in      name, For in their vast progression from the deep they are the same, The deep of deeps, from whose eternal gate all spirit came."
