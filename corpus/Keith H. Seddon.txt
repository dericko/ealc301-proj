"   The Tao that can be put in words is not the ever-abiding Tao; The name that can be named is not the ever-abiding name. The Nameless gives rise to Heaven and Earth. The Named is the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things.  Therefore: It is always so that without desires you can behold its mystery; Always so that having desires you can behold its manifestations. These two are one and the same, and differ only in name. This being so is profound, mysterious, and dark: The threshold to all secrets."
