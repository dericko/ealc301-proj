"   The Way (Tao) that can be named, is not the Ultimate Way. The name given is not the eternal name. Without name is the source of Heaven and Earth. With a name is what creates all things.  Without desires the essence of things can be seen. Who has desires sees only the manifestation of things.  Both aspects have the same source, They become different, subject to perception. But are equal in the depth of depth, From where everything comes into existence."
