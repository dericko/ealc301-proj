"   The Tao that can be told is not the invariant Tao the names that can be named are not the invariant Names.  Nameless, it is the source of the thousands of things (named, it is \u201cMother\u201d of the thousands of things).  Yes: Always: being desireless,      one sees the hidden essentials. Always: having desires,      one sees only what is sought.  These two lines are about The Merging \u2014 it is when things develop and emerge from This that the different names appear.  The Merging is something mysterious \u2014 mysterious and more mysterious the abode of all the hidden essences."
