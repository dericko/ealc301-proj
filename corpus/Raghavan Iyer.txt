"   The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal Name. The Nameless is the source of Heaven and Earth; The named is the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things. Desireless, one may behold the mystery. Desiring, one may see the manifestations. Though one in origin, They emerge with distinct names. Both are mysterious \u2014 Depth within depth \u2014 The threshold of all secrets."
