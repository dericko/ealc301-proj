"   The way you can go isn\u2019t the real way. The name you can say isn\u2019t the real name.  Heaven and earth begin in the unnamed: name\u2019s the mother of the ten thousand things.  So the unwanting soul sees what\u2019s hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.  Two things, one origin, but different in name, whose identity is mystery. Mystery of all mysteries! The door to the hidden."
