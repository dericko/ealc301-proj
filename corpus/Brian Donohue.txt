"   The Cosmic Consciousness described Is not quite the timeless Origin. The Name that one puts into words Fails to hold the Essence.  Beyond the empty division of heaven and earth, The Nameless is \u2014 The living ground of being.  The Nameless bears the Essence; The names reveal the functions Of all the numberless compressions of Being, Born of the vast and silent Mother.  Release your attachment to appearances, And the Tao will be there.  The manifest and the immanent Are of the same Cosmic Origin \u2014 The living, teeming darkness. Eternal, shimmering darkness, Reflecting itself in transformation, Beyond all form and name \u2014 Through the gateway of your own heart."
