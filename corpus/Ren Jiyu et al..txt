"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The named is the root of all things. Therefore, the subtleties of Tao are always apprehended through their formlessness, The limits of things are always seen through their form. These two (the form and the formless) have the same source but different names. Both of them can be called deep and profound, The deepest and the most profound, the door of all mysteries."
