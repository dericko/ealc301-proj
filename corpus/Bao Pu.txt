"   A Dao which can be spoken, is not an enduring Dao. [OR Daos can  guide, but they are not enduring Daos/guides.] A name which can be named, is not an enduring name. [OR Names can be named, but they are not enduring names.] Not named, (Dao is) the origin of the Heavens and the Earth. Having a name, (we call it) the Mother of the myriad things. Therefore, if we are always without desire (to know), We will observe the subtle and unlimited. Always with desire (to know), We will only observe the obvious and limited. These two aspects emerge together and are named differently. This we call a mystery. The mystery of mysteries, The gateway to a multitude of profound subtleties."
