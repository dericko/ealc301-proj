" thence into English by Derek Bryce (1999)   The Reason that can be reasoned is not the eternal Reason. The name that can be named is not the eternal Name. The Unnameable is of heaven and earth the beginning. The Nameable becomes of the ten thousand things the mother.  Therefore it is said:  \u201cHe who desireless is found The spiritual of the world will sound. But he who by desire is bound Sees the mere shell of things around.\u201d  These two things are the same in source but different in name. Their sameness is called a mystery. Indeed, it is the mystery of mysteries. Of all spirituality it is the door."
