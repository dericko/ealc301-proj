"  The way that can be defined to death is not the Way to Life. The road that can be measured is not the endless road. From nothing, the infinite universe began. From no number, the countless things appeared. From no name, their limitless sources will be known.  Looking out, its effects are seen; Looking in, their cause is discovered. With words, these are considered separate; With vision, they are recognized as one."
