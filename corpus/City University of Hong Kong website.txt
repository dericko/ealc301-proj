"   The Way (Tao) that can be told of is not an unvarying Way; The name that can be given is not an unvarying name. Nameless is the beginning of the World. Named is the mother of the myriad creatures.  One experiences without Self to sense the World, And experiences with Self to understand the World. The two experiences are the same within Tao; They are distinct only within the World. Neither experience conveys Tao Which is infinitely greater and more subtle than the World."
