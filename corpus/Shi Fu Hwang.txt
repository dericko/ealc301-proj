"   The Tao is that on which one can always tread. That on which one cannot always tread is not the Tao. And fame is that of which one can always remember. That of which one cannot always remember is not fame. All things are without names prior to the formation of Heaven and Earth. And names are brought out to classify various things. Since there is no name in the very beginning, why should one care about fame! Hence, those who are constantly free of desire of fame shall see the Tao\u2019s subtle secret. Those who bear desire shall see the end lying in front of them. Both two types of men ferment their thinking in the same place, yet they will experience different fates. Both their fates shall be up to Heaven. Beyond our heaven, there are other heavens: whoever knows this shall find the gate of the Tao."
