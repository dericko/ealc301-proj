"   The way that can be talked about is not the eternal Way. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. \u201cNothing\u201d is the name of the origin of heaven and earth. \u201cBeing\u201d is the name of \u201cthe mother\u201d of all things. So, in eternal Nothing, we should look at the wonderfulness of the Way. In eternal Being, we should look at its outer aspects. These two flow from the same source, though differently named; and both are called mysteries. Mysterious and more mysterious. That is the door of all wonders."
