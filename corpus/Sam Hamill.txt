"   Tao defined is not the constant Tao. No name names its eternal name.  The unnamable is the origin of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the ten thousand things.  Emptied of desire, we see the mystery; filled with desire, we see the manifestation of things.  Two names emerge from a single origin, and both are called mysterious,  and the mystery itself is the gateway to perception."
