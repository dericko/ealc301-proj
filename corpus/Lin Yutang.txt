"   The Tao that can be told of      Is not the Absolute Tao; The Names that can be given      Are not Absolute Names.  The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the Mother of All Things.  Therefore: Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion      In order to see the Secret of Life; Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,      In order to see its manifest forms.  These two (the Secret and its manifestations)      Are (in their nature) the same; They are given different names      When they become manifest.  They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery: Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life."
