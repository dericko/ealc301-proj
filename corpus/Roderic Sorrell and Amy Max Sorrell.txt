"   The Tao can be explained, but this is not the real Tao. Names can be given, but these are only a designation.  The origin of Heaven and Earth is called Emptiness. The mother of all things is called Existence.  When we focus on Emptiness, we become aware of the wonder of it all. When we focus on Existence, we become aware of the nature of all things.  These both emerge together, but have different names. Both are called a Mystery. Mystery within Mystery. The doorway to all wonders."
