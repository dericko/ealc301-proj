"   Tao, the subtle reality of the universe      cannot be described. That which can be described in words      is merely a conception of the mind. Although names and descriptions have been applied to it,      the subtle reality is beyond the descriptions.  One may use the word \u201cNothingness\u201d      to describe the Origin of the universe,      and \u201cBeingness\u201d      to describe the Mother of the myriad things,      but Nothingness and Beingness are merely conceptions.  From the perspective of Nothingness,      one may perceive the expansion of the universe. From the perspective of Beingness,      one may distinguish individual things. Both are for the conceptual convenience of the mind.  Although difficult concepts can be applied,      Nothingness and Beingness      and other conceptual activity of the mind      all come from the same indescribable subtle Originalness. The Way is the unfoldment of such subtle reality. Having reached the subtlety of the universe,      one may see the ultimate subtlety,      the Gate of All Wonders."
