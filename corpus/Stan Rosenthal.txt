"   Even the finest teaching is not the Tao itself. Even the finest name is insufficient to define it. Without words, the Tao can be experienced, and without a name, it can be known.  To conduct one\u2019s life according to the Tao, is to conduct one\u2019s life without regrets; to realize that potential within oneself which is of benefit to all.  Though words or names are not required to live one\u2019s life this way, to describe it, words and names are used, that we might better clarify the way of which we speak, without confusing it with other ways in which an individual might choose to live.  Through knowledge, intellectual thought and words, the manifestations of the Tao are known, but without such intellectual intent we might experience the Tao itself.  Both knowledge and experience are real, but reality has many forms, which seem to cause complexity.  By using the means appropriate, we extend ourselves beyond the barriers of such complexity, and so experience the Tao."
