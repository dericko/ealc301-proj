"   The Tao-Path is not the All-Tao. The Name is not the Thing named.  Unmanifested, it is the Secret Father of Heaven and Earth; manifested, it is their Mother.  To understand this Mystery, one must be fulfilling one\u2019s will, and if one is not thus free, one will but gain a smattering of it.  The Tao is one, and the Teh but a phase thereof. The abyss of this Mystery is the Portal of Serpent-Wonder."
