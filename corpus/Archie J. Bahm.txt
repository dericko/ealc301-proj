"   Nature can never be completely described, for such a description of Nature would have to duplicate Nature.  No name can fully express what it represents.  It is Nature itself, and not any part (or name or description) abstracted from Nature, which is the ultimate source of all that happens, all that comes and goes, begins and ends, is and is not.  But to describe Nature as \u201cthe ultimate source of all\u201d is still only a description, and such a description is not Nature itself. Yet since, in order to speak of it, we must use words, we shall have to describe it as \u201cthe ultimate source of all.\u201d  If Nature is inexpressible, he who desires to know Nature as it is in itself will not try to express it in words.  To try to express the inexpressible leads one to make distinctions which are unreal.  Although the existence of Nature and a description of that existence are two different things, yet they are also the same.  For both are ways of existing. That is, a description of existence must have its own existence, which is different from the existence of that which it describes; and so again we have to recognize an existence which cannot be described."
