"   The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. The named is the root of all things. Therefore, by being free from passion and desire, the subtleties of Tao can be experienced. The things existing in the world of duality can be well known by possessing passions and desires. The two above mentioned have the same source but are given different names. The ability of transformation between the two is a most mysterious thing, or the door of all mysteries."
