"   The Tao that can be named      Is not the Absolute Tao; The quality that can be named,      Is not its abiding attribute.  The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth. The Named is the mother of all things.  Truly, only he who frees himself from desire      Can ever see the secret Essences. He who has not conquered passion,      Can only see manifest results.  These two, the manifest and the unmanifest,      Are identical in essence. Though from the self-same mold,      They are given different names.  This unity of essence is the cosmic mystery,      The depth of the great deep,      The doorway to the Secret of all Life."
