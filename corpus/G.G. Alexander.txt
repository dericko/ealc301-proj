"   God (the great everlasting infinite First Cause from whom all things in heaven and earth proceed) can neither be defined nor named.  For the God which can be defined or named is but the Creator, the Great Mother of all those things of which our senses have cognisance.  Now he who would gain a knowledge of the nature and attributes of the nameless and undefinable God, must first set himself free from all earthly desires, for unless he can do this, he will be unable to penetrate the material veil which interposes between him and those spiritual conditions into which he would obtain an insight.  Yet the spiritual and the material, though known to us under different names, are similar in origin, and issue from the same source, and the same obscurity belongs to both, for deep indeed is the darkness which enshrouds the portals through which we have to pass, in order to gain a knowledge of these mysteries."
