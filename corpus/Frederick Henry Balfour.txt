"   The TAO, or Principle of Nature, may be discussed [by all]; it is not the popular or common Tao.  Its Name may be named [i.e., the TAO may receive a designation, though of itself it has none]; but it is not an ordinary name, [or name in the usual sense of the word, for it is a presentment or \u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd of the Infinite].  Its nameless period was that which preceded the birth of the Universe,  In being spoken of by name, it is as the Progenitrix of All Things.  It is therefore in habitual passionlessness [the Quiescent phase of TAO] that its mystery may be scanned; and in habitual desire [the Active phase of TAO] that its developments may be perceived.  These two conditions, the Active and the Quiescent, alike proceed [from TAO]; it is only in name that they differ. Both may be called profundities; and the depth of profundity is the gate of every mystery."
