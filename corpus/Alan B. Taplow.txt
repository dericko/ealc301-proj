"   The true Tao escapes definition, Likewise, Tao is unburdened by Name. Heaven and Earth originated unburdened by Name, However, Name serves well to create All Things.  Unburdened by desire, the essence of Tao unfolds. With desire, its manifestations alone appear. The same source serves both essence and manifestation.  While viewed differently, both are characterized by deep mystery. Deep mystery \u2014 wondrous mystery \u2014 A gateway to the very essence of existence."
