"   Tao that can be spoken of, Is not the Everlasting Tao. Name that can be named, Is not the everlasting name.  Nameless, the origin of heaven and earth; Named, the mother of ten thousand things.  [Alternative: Non-being, to name the origin of heaven and earth; Being, to name the mother of ten thousand things.]  Therefore, always without desire, In order to observe the hidden mystery; Always with desire, In order to observe the manifestations.  [Alternative: Therefore, by the Everlasting Non-Being, We desire to observe its hidden mystery; By the Everlasting Being, We desire to observe the manifestations.]  These two issue from the same origin, Though named differently. Both are called the dark. Dark and even darker, The door to all hidden mysteries."
