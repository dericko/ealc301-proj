"   The Tao that can be told Is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named Is not the eternal name.  The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth; The named is the mother of the myriad beings.  Always remain free from desires \u2014 And you can see its wonder. Always cherish desires \u2014 And you can only observe its outcome.  Both these develop together But have different names; They are part of the mystery.  Mysterious and more mysterious \u2014 The gate of all that\u2019s wondrous."
