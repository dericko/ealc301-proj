"   Way-making that can be put into words is not really way-making, And naming that can assign fixed reference to things is not really naming.  The nameless is the fetal beginning of everything that is happening, While that which is named is their mother.  Thus, to be really objectless in one\u2019s desires is how one observes the mysteries of all things, While really having desires is how one observes their boundaries.  These two \u2014 the nameless and what is named \u2014 emerge from the same source yet are referred to differently.  Together they are called obscure. The obscurest of the obscure, They are the swinging gateway of the manifold mysteries."
