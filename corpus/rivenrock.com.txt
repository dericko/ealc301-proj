"   The TAO that can be expressed in words is not the all-embracing and immutable TAO: the Name that can be spoken is not the eternal Name. Without a name, It is the Beginning of The Universe and Our World: conceived as having a name, It is the Progenitrix of all things. Those alone who are free from earthly passions can perceive the deep mystery of the Unmanifested One: those who are possessed by desires can only behold the Manifest\u2019s outward form. These two, the Manifest and the Unmanifest, although differing in name, in essence are identical. This sameness is the mystery, the deep within the deep, the door of many mysteries.  Translation by Steven Ericsson Zenith (date unknown),  based on the version published by The Shrine of Wisdom (1924)   The Tao that is spoken of, cannot be truly explained. The grandest eloquence cannot define it. It has no name, and is the creator of Heaven and Earth. Forced to name it, we can call it the Tao (the Way), and accept that it is great. When we are lost in desire we can see only the outer manifestations of this greatness. If we free ourselves from desire we can experience the unfathomable depths, and know the mystery of the great Tao. The Mystery and the Manifestations are separate, yet they arise from the same source. This source is deep; so deep its depths cannot be plumbed. Within its depths is darkness. The Great Mystery within the darkness, it is the gateway to all understanding."
