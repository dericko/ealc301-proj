"   The Dao that can be described in language is not the constant Dao; the name that can be given it is not its constant name.  Nameless, it is the origin of the myriad things; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.  Therefore, always be without desire so as to see their subtlety.  And always have desire so as to see their ends.  These two emerge together but have different names. Together, we refer to them as mystery; the mystery upon mystery and gateway of all subtleties."
