"   As for the Way, the Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way; As for names, the name that can be named is not the constant name. The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousands things; The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.  Therefore, those constantly without desires, by this means will perceive its subtlety. Those constantly with desires by this means will see only that which they yearn for and seek.  These two together emerge; They have different names yet they\u2019re called the same; That which is even more profound than the profound \u2014 The gateway of all subtleties."
