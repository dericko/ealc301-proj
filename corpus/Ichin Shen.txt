"   Tao that can be described is not the constant Tao.  Name that can be named is not a constant name.  The beginning of heaven and earth has no name, naming is the beginning of all things.  So, constantly observe it with no-mind, one [can] see the mystery [of Tao]; to be ever distinctive, one [can] see the manifestations [of Tao].  [Originally,] these two phenomenon (the mystery and the manifestations) are springing from the same source, only names are different.  To see (comprehend) them as the same makes deep wonder; wonder upon wonder, [intuitive comprehension is] the gateway to all mysteries [of Tao]."
