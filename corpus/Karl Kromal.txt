"   The perceived Way is not the eternal Way. The common name is not the eternal Name.  The Beginning of Heaven and Earth has no name. The Mother of all things has a name.  Free of desire, behold its mystery. Bound by desire, observe only its form.  These two are the same, but their forms bear different names. Together, they are a mystery, subtle and profound, the gateway to understanding."
