"   As for the road, The Road that can be told is not the eternal Road. As for names, The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of the ten thousand things. The named is the mother of the ten thousand things. Therefore, ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Those constantly with desires, will only see what they yearn for and seek. These two spring from the same source. They have different names; yet they are called the same. That which is even more profound than the profound The gateway to all mystery."
