"  The Tao that can be known is not Tao.  The substance of the World is only a name for Tao.  Tao is all that exists and may exist;  The World is only a map of what exists and may exist.   One experiences without Self to sense the World,  And experiences with Self to understand the World.  The two experiences are the same within Tao;  They are distinct only within the World.  Neither experience conveys Tao  Which is infinitely greater and more subtle than the World.  \u201cInterpolation\u201d by Peter Merel, based on the versions by Lin Yutang, Ch'u Ta-Kao, Gia-Fu Feng/Jane English, Richard Wilhelm, and Aleister Crowley  (in progress)  The Tao that can be described in words is not the true Tao The Name that can be named is not the true Name.  From non-existence were called Heaven and Earth From existence all things were born  In being without desires, you experience the wonder But by having desires, you experience the journey. Yet both spring from the same source and differ mostly in name.  This source is called \u201cMystery\u201d Mystery upon Mystery The womb giving birth to all of being."
