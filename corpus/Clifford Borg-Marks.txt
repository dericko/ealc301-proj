"   Alas this very spoken Dao is not the constant one. So find a name for name and you have nothing but a pun.  The nameless was the source that made the planet and its sky. The named one is all creatures\u2019 mom, and maybe this is why.  The mystery of the Dao is felt through nothing \u2014 that\u2019s the key. Its limits manifest themselves in everything we see.  Now both of these share ancestors though they share names no more. A mystery within mystery and every mystery\u2019s door."
