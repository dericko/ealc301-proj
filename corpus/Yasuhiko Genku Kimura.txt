"   The Tao Eternal is beyond definition. No name given can capture its eternality. Nameless, it is the origin of the Kosmos. Named, it is the beginning of all things. Nothingness, it is the inner being of the Kosmos. Thingness, it is the outer distinctions of the Kosmos. These two, though different in names, arise from the same source: The source called the Invisible. Invisible beyond the invisible, It is the entry into the myriad wonders of the Eternal Kosmos."
