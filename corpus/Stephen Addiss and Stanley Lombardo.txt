"   TAO called Tao is not TAO.  Names can name no lasting name.  Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of the ten thousand things.  Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations.  These have the same source, but different names.      Call them both deep \u2014           Deep and again deep:  The gateway to all mystery."
