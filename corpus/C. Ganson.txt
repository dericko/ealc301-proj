"     The Tao described in words is not the real Tao. Words cannot describe it. Nameless, it is the source of creation. Named, it is the mother of all things.  To see Tao the observer must be motiveless. Those with selfish motives see only the surface, not the innermost depths.  These two kinds of observers look alike, but differ in the insight of their observations. They look alike because they are both human. Within humanity is the key to the door of creation."
