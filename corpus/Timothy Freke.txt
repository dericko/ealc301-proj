"   Tao is not a way that can be pointed out. Nor an idea that can be defined.  Tao is indefinable original totality. Ideas create the appearance of separate things.  Always hidden, it is the mysterious essence. Always manifest, it is the outer appearances.  Essence and appearance are the same. Only ideas make them seem separate.  Mystified? Tao is mystery. This is the gateway to understanding."
