"   Tao: speak the tao. It is not the eternal tao. Name: speak the name. It is not the eternal name. Unnamed at first, sky and earth emerge. Naming generates ten thousand things.  So: never seeking, we glimpse infinitesimals. Always seeking, we mark boundaries.  Both there from the start, given opposite names. Out of the deep, Deep mirrored in deep, Infinitesimals multiplied open all gates."
