"   TAO (THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE) can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao (Laws of the Universe). Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name. (You cannot name the unknown.) As the origin of heaven-and-earth, it is not describable: As \u201cthe Mother\u201d of all things, it is describable. (You cannot describe the unknown origin.) As it is always hidden, We should look at its Inner Sum and Substance (through philosophy and poetry): As always visible, We should look at its Outer Form (through science and observation). These two flow from the same source (the Laws of the Universe,) though differently named; And both are called mysteries. The Mystery of mysteries is the Gate of all sum and substance. (Beyond the gate of experience is the Way. It is in all ways greater and more subtle than the world.)"
