"   The tao that can be described is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be spoken is not the eternal Name.  The nameless is the boundary of Heaven and Earth. The named is the mother of creation.  Freed from desire, you can see the hidden mystery. By having desire, you can only see what is visibly real.  Yet mystery and reality emerge from the same source. This source is called darkness.  Darkness born from darkness. The beginning of all understanding."
