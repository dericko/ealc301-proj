"   The Tao that can be told is not the universal Tao. The name that can be named is not the universal name.  In the infancy of the universe, there were no names. Naming fragments the mysteries of life into ten thousand things and their manifestations.  Yet mystery and manifestation spring from the same source: The Great Integrity which is the mystery within manifestation, the manifestation within mystery, the naming of the unnamed, and the un-naming of the named.  When these interpenetrations are in full attendance, we will pass the gate of naming notions in our journey toward transcendence."
