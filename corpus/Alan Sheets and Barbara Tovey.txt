"   The Tao is the unobstructed breath. The Tao holds the opposing forces of the eternal Tao.  The Name is the unobstructed breath. The Name holds the opposing forces of the eternal Name.  Heaven and Earth were without names (consciousness) in the beginning. The names of the ten-thousand things (everything) arose through its mother.  If you are eternally without deep-seated desires, then you perceive its mystery. If you have deep-seated desires, then you perceive its outer form. These both (the essence and outer form) have the same origin but have different names.  Oneness (the Source) is called the mystery. The mystery will always be mysterious. All people are at the door of this mysterious One."
