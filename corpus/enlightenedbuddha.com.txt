"   The Way cannot be said in words. Infinity cannot be described. Eternity cannot be named. Naming is the basis of temporary things. Without desire there is mystery. Bound to desire we are trapped in the known. Mystery and the known are not separate. It is naming which separates us. The entry to all understanding lies in this paradox."
