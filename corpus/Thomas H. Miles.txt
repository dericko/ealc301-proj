"   The tao that can be described is not the Constant Tao. The name that can be named is not the Constant Name.  Something-Without-A-Name is the beginning of Heaven and Earth. Something-Having-A-Name is the mother of all the ten-thousand things.  Therefore, constantly being without desire, you can behold the subtleties. Constantly having desire, you can behold the manifestations.  These are two things. They issue forth from the Sameness but have different names. This Sameness is called \u201cProfound,\u201d the Profundity of the Profound, the Gate of the Collective Subtlety."
